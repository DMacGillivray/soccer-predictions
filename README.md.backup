## 1. Business Opportunity: Odds Advice

### 1.1 Customer

As more states [legalize sports betting](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/in-2020-we-will-see-how-widespread-legalized-sports-betting-becomes-2019-12-18), the opportunities to provide bettor services grows.

The business proposal is a web service that enables a bettor to identify profitable bets on European soccer games

### 1.2 Service Description


The scope will be for 3 of the top European Leagues

+ English Premier League - 20 teams playing 380 games per season
+ German Bundesliga - 18 teams playing 306 games per season
+ Italian Serie A - 20 teams playing 380 games per season

Each league season is structured the same way. Every team plays every other team at home and away, and each game has one of four outcomes:

+ Home Team Wins
+ Draw
+ Away Team Wins
+ Game Abandoned (or some other unique event occurs) - This is so rare that it will be neglected in this analysis

The web service will provide a list of upcoming games, along with the minimum odds required to make a profitable bet.

So, if for example, on Saturday, there are 20 games being played across these 3 leagues, 60 minimum odds recommendations will be made - 3 for each game - An example is shown below:

</p>

### 1.3 Customer Value

The bettor will take these numbers and scan the Sports Books for odds higher than these. For the service to be good, it needs to consistently find the minimum odds needed to enable a bettor to make profitable bets over the long run. Note that it may not always possible to find profitable odds at the Sports Books.

So if I want to bet on Liverpool winning their 21 January game against Manchester United, I would find a Sports Book giving decimal odds higher than 1.5, and place the bet.

### 1.4 Business Objective

Identify break-even odds for the next set of soccer games to be played in the Premier League, Bundesliga, and Serie A

## 2. Data Science Objective

Develop a model based on free & publicly available data that will identify break-even odds for the next set of soccer games to be played in the Premier League, Bundesliga, and Serie A

## 3. Understanding the Data Science Objective

### 3.1 Randomness in Soccer Games

There is a significant degree of [randomness involved in soccer games](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/08/science/soccer-a-beautiful-game-of-chance.html). We can never really know with 100% confidence what the final score will be. This is very different to a standard classification problem - say classifying images of cats and dogs. For cats and dogs there is a solid ground truth for the class. A cat is a cat with 100% certainty. A random outcome, like a Soccer game result is different; We can never get to the point where we are predicting a single outcome with 100% certainty, because the outcome itself is uncertain.

I propose that if we do a thought experiment and imagine that a football game between the same 2 teams was played 100 times, we could reasonably assume that we would not get the same final score for all 100 games. In fact it could be argued that the inherent randomness in the game is what makes it so exciting, and hence so popular.

Because of the probabilistic nature of the outcome, we need to carefully consider the types of models we use to classify game outcomes. **Our objective is not accurate classification, but accurate probabilities.**

### 3.2 What Makes a Profitable Bet?

We can think of a football game like this. If the same game were played a million times, how would the possible outcomes be proportioned?

Let us assume we simulated 1,000,000 games, and imagine the home team won 320,000 times, there was a draw 270,000 times, and the away team won 410,000 times

With this (imaginary) data we would be able to say the probability distribution for the game results would be as follows:

Home Win                 |	Draw     | Away Win
:------------------------:|:--------------:|:------------:
0.32                   |	0.27    | 0.41

The next component to the bet is the odds.

If we go to 2 Sports Books and find the following odds for home wins â€“ How do we know which bets are profitable?

Odds # 1                 |	Odds # 2
:------------------------:|:--------------:
2.92                   |	3.30


 
We can calculate the Expected Value of the bet, to see which odds are favourable

Expected Value (EV) is the probability of winning the bet multiplied by the potential winnings minus the probability of losing the bet multiplied by our potential loss.

In the following calculations we will call the amount we will place on the bet the stake, and assume it equals 1 unit. We now have all the elements needed to make an Expected Value calculation.

+ probability of winning: 0.32
+ probability of losing: 1 - probability of winning, or 1 - 0.32 = 0.68
+ potential winnings: odds - stake, or odds - 1 when stake = 1
+ potential loss: stake, or 1

<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=EV&space;=&space;(probability\;of\;winning\;bet&space;\times&space;(odds&space;-&space;stake)))&space;-&space;(probability\;of\;losing\;bet&space;\times&space;-&space;stake))" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?EV&space;=&space;(probability\;of\;winning\;bet&space;\times&space;(odds&space;-&space;stake)))&space;-&space;(probability\;of\;losing\;bet&space;\times&space;-&space;stake))" title="EV = (probability\;of\;winning\;bet \times (odds - stake))) - (probability\;of\;losing\;bet \times - stake))" /></a>

If we apply this formula to our different odds, and use a unit stake, we get:

+ Odds # 1:

 <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=EV&space;=&space;(0.32&space;\times&space;(2.92\;&space;-\;&space;1))\;&space;&plus;\;&space;((1-0.32)&space;\times&space;-&space;1)&space;=&space;-0.0656" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?EV&space;=&space;(0.32&space;\times&space;(2.92\;&space;-\;&space;1))\;&space;&plus;\;&space;((1-0.32)&space;\times&space;-&space;1)&space;=&space;-0.0656" title="EV = (0.32 \times (2.92\; -\; 1))\; +\; ((1-0.32) \times - 1) = -0.0656" /></a>
+ Odds # 2:

 <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=EV&space;=&space;(0.32&space;\times&space;(3.30\;&space;-\;&space;1))\;&space;&plus;\;&space;((1-0.32)&space;\times&space;-&space;1)&space;=&space;0.056" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?EV&space;=&space;(0.32&space;\times&space;(3.30\;&space;-\;&space;1))\;&space;&plus;\;&space;((1-0.32)&space;\times&space;-&space;1)&space;=&space;0.056" title="EV = (0.32 \times (3.30\; -\; 1))\; +\; ((1-0.32) \times - 1) = +0.056" /></a>

So, If we can get Odds #2, we have a positive EV bet, and if we trust our probability prediction, we should place the bet. Alternatively, if we can only get Odds #1, we have a negative EV, and we should avoid the bet.

Clearly, even with positive EV, we may lose this particular bet. In fact, we recognize we have only a 32% probability of winning the bet, which means we have a much higher - 68% - probability of losing the bet. However, over the long run, if we are correctly identifying, and placing, positive EV bets, we will make money.

The counter-intuitive implication of using EV, is that if we find 2 positive EV bets on the same game - say Home Win, and Draw, then in theory we should place both bets! We will deal with this issue later.



### 3.3 Implied Probability and the Overround

The Sports Book will produces a set of odds for a game that looks like this:

Home Win                 |	Draw     | Away Win
:------------------------:|:--------------:|:------------:
2.92                   |	3.52    | 2.3

These odds can be converted to "probabilities" - We just need to divide the odds into 1.

Home Win                 |	Draw     | Away Win
:------------------------:|:--------------:|:------------:
2.92                   |	3.52    | 2.3
0.342                   |	0.284    | 0.435

However, looking at these numbers, it is clear that they are not real probabilities. The problem is when we add them together, they sum to 1.061. We know that these 3 outcomes are the only possible outcomes, so "real" probabilities should sum to exactly 1. What explains this discrepancy?

This is where the Sports Book makes money, and is known as the [overround or the "vig"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics_of_bookmaking#Making_a_'book'_(and_the_notion_of_overround))

However, we can normalize these 3 numbers back to implied probabilities by dividing by the sum

The table below shows Expected Value calculations on some typical odds
